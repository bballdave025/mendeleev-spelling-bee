# language-resources

This is a place to put dictionaries from multiple languages. Other
resources for NLP/Linguistics will be put here as needed. It is
foreseen that this folder will exist for multiple projects here on
GitHub. I'm going to grab some stuff from other projects, then
collect them here.

This first folder where I'm including the README is for the
`mendeleev-spelling-bee` repository. Here, a search such as the one
used in the old BYU Boggle project will be used to find the different
combinations of Mendeleev Chart (Periodic Table) element symbols that
create words existing in the dictionaries for different languages.

@TODO : put in descriptions of the resources and how they might be used.
