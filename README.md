# mendeleev-spelling-bee
A little NLP fun, finding which words can be made using only the symbols of Mendeleev's Table (perhaps more commonly, though less justly) also known as the Periodic Table. The trick here is that we will use multiple languages. Even scripts (to the degree that they can be found), starting with Cyrillic.
