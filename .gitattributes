#  Mostly here to preserve *NIX-style line endings, which are very important
#+ for certain data and text files in the Bourne Again SHell (bash) files, 
#+ ... The python files don't care.

#  Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified

##image files (at least one now in the repo) 
#*.png            binary
#*.jpg            binary
##audio files (none yet in the repo)
#*.wav            binary

##video files (none yet in the repo)
#*.mp4            binary
##other binaries
#*.xcf            binary



## The following extensions exist on files inside the .git directory.
## I assume that, with the 'auto', git will take care of them.
# *.sample ; *.pack ; *.idx


##  EXPLANATORY COMMENTS ##
#  Set the default behavior, in case people don't have `core.autocrlf` set.

## Specific files that ABSOLUTELY need to be treated as text and have
#+ *NIX-style endings. (Note we have no `*.ext text`, because we do
#+ not want any files normalized and converted to native line endings
#+ on checkout.) We also hate CRLF endings, unless someone has built
#+ on VS.
#+ The LF line endings should always be there on checkout.
